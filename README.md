In the RISC-V and Artificial Intelligence hackathon, we were tasked with implementing the SHA-256 encryption, which encrypts passwords by transforming and altering the content of strings.

Since the algorithm involves numerous operations and lengthy computations, there is a need to reduce the execution time and resource consumption for the algorithm to perform efficiently. With the help of the AI accelerator, we aim to achieve our goal: reducing the execution time, obtaining faster results, and using fewer resources (by implementing it in Verilog).

The entire process was carried out using C files and Verilog files.
